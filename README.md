# My pseudo portfolio site

This required project for HTML+CSS section of the course.

It more-or-less works

# Assumptions

When working on the site I tried to follow few assumptions:
  * Use Solarized colors (for consistency)
  * Keep away from images
  * Try to 'generate' all the graphics
  * Screw IE, no one should use it anymore
